## Transform into tidy data frames

The Fitabase data set has the following characteristics:

* Tables encoded in different formats, including both narrow and wide
* Variables sampled at different rates, e.g. per-second and per-day
* Tables containing duplicated or summarised data from other tables.
* CapitalisedVariableNames
* snake_case_file_names
* Inconsistent file names: file names generally include the feature and polling rate, but not in the same format across files
* Duplicate data, e.g. weight logs in both kilos and pounds in the same table


Of these features, some are better understood by analysing the summarized data:

* sleepDay_merged (I don't need intra-night sleep stats)

Others are better understood by analysing the base/narrow data:

*

## Identify Raw Data Tables

The following base/narrow data tables are included in the Fitabase data set:

* heartrate_seconds_merged
* minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged
* minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged
* minuteMETsNarrow_merged
* minuteStepsNarrow_merged
* minuteSleep_merged
* weightLogInfo_merged

These data tables contain all of the data included in the summary tables.

While the summary tables provides some useful ready-made summaries and potential for visualisation, further processing with R will benefit from isolating the unique data sets and re-organising them into tidy data. "Tidy data" means:

* One table (or data frame) per observational unit (e.g. one for sleep, one for steps, etc.)
* One variable per table column
* One observation per table row
